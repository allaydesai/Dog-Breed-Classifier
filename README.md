## OVERVIEW

In this project, I built a pipeline that can be used within a web or mobile app to process real-world, user-supplied images.  Given an image of a dog, the algorithm identifies an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed.  If supplied an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed.

Along with exploring state-of-the-art CNN models for classification and localization, There are important design decisions about the user experience for your app.  The goal is to understand the challenges involved in piecing together a series of models designed to perform various tasks in a data processing pipeline.  Each model has its strengths and weaknesses, and engineering a real-world application often involves solving many problems without a perfect answer.  This imperfect solution nonetheless creates a fun user experience!

## RESULTS

### Face Detection
OpenCV's implementation of Haar feature-based cascade classifiers to detect human faces in images.

[image]

100%, Total 100 human faces found in 100 human images
This is the accuracy

16%, Total 16 human faces found in 100 dog images
This is the error rate

### Dog Detection

Detect Dogs using VGG-16 model, along with weights that have been trained on ImageNet. Dictionary keys 151-268, inclusive are dog breeds.


100.0%, Total 100 dog faces found in 100 dog images
This is the accuracy

0.0%, Total 0 dog faces found in 100 human images
This is the error rate

### Dog Breed Detection using CNN from Scratch

**CNN Architecture**

| Layer Name | Description |
|-----|----------:|
| Conv1 | Conv_3-64 |
| Conv2 | Conv_64-128 |
| Conv3 | Conv_128-256 |
